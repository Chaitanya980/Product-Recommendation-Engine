# 📌 Product Recommendation Engine

This repository contains a machine learning-powered Product Recommendation Engine built using collaborative filtering and vector similarity techniques. It recommends products based on user behavior and item similarity.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates building a recommendation system that can:

- Suggest personalized products to users
- Use real-world purchase or rating data
- Compute similarity using metrics like cosine similarity
- Deliver fast, relevant recommendations

This engine can be adapted for e-commerce, content platforms, and personalization pipelines.

##  Tech Stack 

This project is built with:

- **Python** – Core implementation language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing and manipulation  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Similarity and machine learning utilities  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development and visualization  
- **Pickle** – Model & data persistence

## What I’m Working On!

I’m actively improving this project by focusing on:

1. Adding **implicit feedback models** (e.g., ALS)  
2. Expanding **dataset support** for larger real-world data  
3. Deploying as an **API service** for real-time recommendations
